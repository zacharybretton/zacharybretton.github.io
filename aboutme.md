I'm **Zachary Bretton**, a Cognitive and Computational Neuroscientist with a freshly earned Ph.D., eager to transition from academia into the dynamic world of data science and analytics. Brooklyn born and raised, I've spent the last five years in Austin, TX, deep in research at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and cognition.

At the **University of Texas**, my work focused on uncovering the neural mechanisms and long-term impacts of working memory suppression. I used advanced data analytics, machine learning, and high-performance computing to turn complex fMRI data into actionable insights. My research journey began with a **B.A. in Neurobiology** from **Boston University**, where I worked in the Baum Lab studying olfaction and the response to sexual signaling. This was followed by hands-on research experience as a technician and lab manager in the Neural Circuits lab at **Columbia University Medical Center**, studying rodent models of mental illness and leveraging in-vivo electrophysiological recordings. Along the way, I’ve honed my ability to tackle big data problems, communicate and visualize findings, develop new technical and coding skills, lead teams, and deliver meaningful results.

Now, I'm excited to take these skills beyond the lab and into the real world. My passion for data science and analytics lies in its potential to solve complex problems and drive impactful decisions across industries. Whether it's optimizing business strategies, improving healthcare outcomes, or maximizing efficiency on the basketball court, I’m ready to bring my expertise and energy to the table.

When I'm not working on data-driven projects, you can find me cheering on the **Brooklyn Nets** (Let's go Nets!) or spending time with my amazing wife **Dr. Shelby Bretton**, and our dog, **Tycho**. Whether you're interested in the latest in data science, machine learning, or want to debate about the NBA, I'm always up for a conversation.
