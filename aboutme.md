I'm **Zachary Bretton**, a Cognitive and Computational Neuroscientist with a freshly earned Ph.D., eager to transition from academia into the dynamic world of data science and analytics. Born and raised in Brooklyn, NY (a fact I’m quite proud of), I've spent the last five years in Austin, TX, where I’ve been deep in research at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning and cognition.

At the University of Texas, my work focused on uncovering the neural mechanisms of working memory suppression, using advanced data analytics and high-performance computing to turn complex fMRI data into actionable insights. My journey began with a B.A. in Neurobiology from Boston University, followed by hands-on research experience at Columbia University Medical Center. Along the way, I’ve honed my ability to tackle big data problems, communicate and visualize my findings, hone new technical or coding skills, lead teams, and deliver meaningful results.

Now, I'm excited to take these skills beyond the lab and into the real world. My passion for data science lies in its potential to solve complex problems and drive impactful decisions across industries. Whether it's optimizing business strategies, improving healthcare outcomes or maximizing efficiency on the basketball court, I’m ready to bring my analytical expertise to the table.

When I'm not working on data-driven projects, you can find me cheering on the Brooklyn Nets (Let's go Nets!) or spending time with my amazing wife Dr. Shelby Bretton, and our dog, Tycho. Whether you're interested in the latest in data science, machine learning or want to debate about the NBA, I'm always up for a conversation.
